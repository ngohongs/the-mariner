Avast ye, me hearties! Are ye ready to embark on a perilous journey across the open seas? If ye are, then weigh anchor and set sail, for the adventure of a lifetime awaits!
But beware, for the waters can be treacherous, and ye must keep a sharp lookout for rocks, shoals, and other hazards that could scuttle yer ship. Move like a king in chess, one tile at a time, but make sure to stay within the bounds of the purple lines that mark the playing field.
And don't forget to keep a watchful eye on yer supplies, especially the food that's essential to keep yer crew fed and happy. The amount of food ye have is displayed in the upper left corner of the screen, so keep it well-stocked to avoid running out and facing a mutiny!
So hoist the sails, trim the sheets, and let the winds carry ye to glory! And if ye can make it to the end of the sea, ye'll have shown yer mettle as a seasoned sailor and navigator. But that's not all, me hearties. 
The ultimate goal of this journey is to prove to none other than Christopher Columbus himself that the earth is flat. So set yer sights on the horizon and sail on with purpose!
