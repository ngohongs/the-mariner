Let me tell you, my friend... sailing these waters won't be as easy as you think. You may be devoted flat-earther, but the obstacles will still put your skills to the test.
Do you see the brown boundary around the map? If you stray off course too much, the crew will loose interest, so make sure you don't. You can't sail ship this big alone.
Now, if you ever feel lost, don't forget to look into your logbook. It's your invaluable companion, waiting for you in the right corner of your screen.
Oh... and last thing. Don't forget to collect food barrels. It is an essential resource for surviving on this voyage.
Anyway, are you ready? May the best sailor win.
